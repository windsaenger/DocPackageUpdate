# Feature Release: Dark Mode

We're excited to announce that Deploy Now now has a new dark mode feature! With dark mode, you can now switch the interface from light to dark mode, making it easier on your eyes and reducing eye strain when working in low-light conditions.

To activate dark mode, simply click on the moon in the navigation bar.

With this feature, you can now work comfortably and more efficiently, no matter the time of day or lighting conditions. We hope this new feature makes your Deploy Now experience even better!
