# Build and stage a Gatsby site with Deploy Now

Developing frontends oftentimes involves a lot of back and forth, experiments and feedback loops. We've created [Staging Deployments](https://docs.ionos.space/docs/staging-deployments/) to make this process more convenient.
Wayne from the YouTube Channel Devscover shows in his newest video how easy Staging Deployments can be created based on a Gatsby example. Simply create a new feature branch on GitHub and preview your changes in a Staging Deployment before merging them to production.
Every Staging Deployment goes live under a preview URL that you can share with colleagues or customers to get feedback.

Do you like the example website deployed in the video? [Sign up for Deploy Now](https://www.ionos.com/hosting/deploy-now?utm_source=deploy-now-docs&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=gatsby-staging) and hit this button to deploy your own version.
